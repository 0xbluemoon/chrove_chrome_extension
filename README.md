# [Chrove proxy](https://chrove.com): The first self-service proxy you can order anonymously

Did you ever imagine that you can anonymously order an internet proxy starts at  0.01 USD per hour?

You don’t need to:

1. Register account
2. Verify email
3. Input credit card number
4. Input bill address
5. Fill proxy server address, account, and password by yourself.
It is a good solution to protect your browsing history when you use wifi in a cafe, a hotel, or other public space. 

The Chrove proxy is the first self-service proxy that you can order anonymously. The proxy is ready in one minute after you pay. You just need to install a small Google Chrome extension and pay cryptocurrency.

Why anonymous matter?

People often need an internet proxy to protect their privacy in public free wifi. People in Iran, Russian and China need an internet proxy to bypass censorship. A proxy purchase record or an email from a proxy vendor can hurt people because this information links an online account to real people.

The payment is not anonymous, the service is not autonomous. 

Inspired by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), we introduce an anonymous and self-service model in proxy business.

People **anonymously** pay cryptocurrency,  vendor **anonymously** provides **autonomous** service. Service is automatically delivered to the client even they don’t know each other. People on both sides are safe.

The model brings one more benefit: customer can order a 2 hours on-demand internet protection service by 0.01 USD, it is impossible before.

Chrove proxy is powered by a software protocol: [Chrove](https://github.com/0xbluemoon/Chrove_protocol). The protocol enables people to anonymously pay and enjoy digital service without a complicated registration process.

The Chrove protocol is based on EOS now, it will support more cryptocurrency.
